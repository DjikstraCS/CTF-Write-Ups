## Python script:
The Python script is recursively converting all .md files in Obsidian to GitHub compatible Markdown.

Does this by adding the full file path of **pasted** images.

1.  Put it anywhere in your Obsidian vault. 
	-  It will convert all files in that directory, plus all of its subdirectories.
2.  Edit the 'attachments' folder path to local path if necessary.
3.  Execute directly from Obsidian and watch the magic happen.
