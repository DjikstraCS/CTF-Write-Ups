## Python script:
The Python script is converting all .md files in Obsidian to GitHub compatible Markdown.

Does this by adding the full file path to **pasted** images.

### Install:
'Default location for new attachments' needs to be 'in sub folder under current folder'.

Obsidian Settings -> Files and links -> Default location for new attachments -> In sub folder under current folder -> Subfolder name -> '*attachments*'.

1. Put the script anywhere in your Obsidian vault 
	- It will convert current directory plus all subdirectories.
2. Edit the '*attachments*' folder path in script to local path if necessary.
3. Execute directly from Obsidian and watch the magic happen.
