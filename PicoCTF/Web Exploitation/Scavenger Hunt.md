## Problem:

---
## Hints:
1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forceer.

---
## Solution:
This look just like the 'Insp3ct0r' challenge.

The site has two buttons, If we click on 'What' on it, we will be presented with a list.

This is probably where we will find our flags.

Right click anywhere -> 'Inspect (Q)'.

We will first have a look at the HTML section of the page. By clicking the small arrows, we can expand the different sections of the page to investigate.

And we find the first part of the flag embedded in the HTML.

Under the 'Style Editor' tab, we can see the CSS style sheets of the page.

And there is part number 2.

JavaScript files are found under 'Debugger'

In the 'insp3ct0r' challenge, the third flag was found here. This is different.

How can I keep Google from indexing my website?

Websites can put a robots.txt file in their root directory to tell search engines not to index certain pages. Simply type '/robots.txt' after the URL in the browser and hit enter.

There we have the third part of the flag. And a hint about an Apache server.

Apache servers have a configuration file in the root directory just like robots.txt, it's called '.htaccess'.

Same again.

This time it's a hint about a Mac computer.

Mac computers store a hidden file in their folders containing metadata about the files in said folder. Maybe the creator didn't notice and uploaded it to the live website without knowing. The file is called '.DS_Store'.

And there is the fifth and last part of the flag!
