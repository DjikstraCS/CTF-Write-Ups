## Problem:

## Hints:
1. There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
2. Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

## Solution:
We get a website with a list of Irish actors. In the menu, we can see there is a support page and an admin login page.

Let's see if we can get through the login page with an SQL Injection.

Username: `' or 1=1--`

Password: `<BLANK>`

Success! That simple SQL Injection gave us access to the system, and we got the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_f8adf3fb}`
