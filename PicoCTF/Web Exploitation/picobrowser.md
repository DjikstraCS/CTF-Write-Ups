## Problem:

## Hints:
1. You don't need to download a new web browser

---
## Solution:
On the page there is a green button labeled flag, when we click it we get an error.

We need to change the 'User-Agent' of the browser to 'picobrowser' in order to view the flag.

There are a few Firefox extensions that can help with that. I found that 'User-agent Switcher and Manager' does the job perfectly.

Open the extension, set the User-Agent and click apply.

Clock the flag button again.

We got the flag!

**Flag:** `picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}`
