## Problem:

## Solution:
After inspecting the site, it appears that there is something interesting about this JavaScript.

We can use [jsnice](http://www.jsnice.org/) to get at better view of the script.

There are two interesting values, looks like Base64. Let's try and decode them.

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ echo 'YWRtaW4' | base64 --decode
admin
                                                                                                                           
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ echo 'cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ' | base64 --decode
picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
```

And there we have the flag!

**Flag:** `picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}`
