## Problem:

## Hints:
1. Never trust the client

## Solution:

If we inspect the page, we find this JS code in the index.html file.

We can see the flag, but it looks like it is split into multiple strings.

If we look carefully at the code, we can piece the flag together by adding the splits in the right order. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{no_clients_plz_1a3c89}`
