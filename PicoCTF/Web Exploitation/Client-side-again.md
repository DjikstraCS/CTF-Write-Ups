## Problem:

## Hints:
1. What is obfuscation?

---
## Solution:
This is like [dont-use-client-side](https://github.com/DjikstraCS/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/PicoCTF/Web%20Exploitation/dont-use-client-side.md). A simple page with a login section.

Upon inspection, we find a JavaScript, but it looks very complicated. Almost like someone intentionally tried it to make it hard to understand. There is an excellent tool called [jsnice](http://www.jsnice.org/) we can use to help us.

There are two interesting sections, in the top we can see a list containing fragments of a flag.

In the bottom we can see how the verify function works. It still looks confusing, though, all the values have obfuscated names.  

We need an easy way to decode the values, here the JS console in the Firefox inspection tool will come in handy.

Although it is in the wrong order, it is pretty easy to piece the final flag together.
