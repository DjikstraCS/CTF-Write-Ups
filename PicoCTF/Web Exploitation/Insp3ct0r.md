## Problem:

## Hints:
1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
2. There's 3 parts

---
## Solution:
The site has two buttons, If we click on 'How' on it, we will be presented with a list.

This is probably where we will find our flags.

Right click anywhere -> 'Inspect (Q)'.

We will first have a look at the HTML section of the page. By clicking the small arrows, we can expand the different sections of the page to investigate.

And we find the first part of the flag embedded in the HTML.

Under the 'Style Editor' tab, we can see the CSS style sheets of the page.

And there is part number 2.

JavaScript files are found under 'Debugger'

And here we find the last part of the flag.
