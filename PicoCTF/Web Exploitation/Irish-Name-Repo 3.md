## Problem:

---
## Hints:
1. Seems like the password is encrypted.

---
## Solution:
This is a lot like [Irish-Name-Repo 1](https://github.com/DjikstraCS/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/PicoCTF/Web%20Exploitation/Irish-Name-Repo%201.md) and [Irish-Name-Repo 2](https://github.com/DjikstraCS/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/PicoCTF/Web%20Exploitation/Irish-Name-Repo%202.md).

We need to get through the login portal. This time, though, there is no username field, only a password is required.

Let's try a simple payload.

Password: `' or 1=1--`

Just a blank page. The hint suggests the password input is encrypted. We need to dig deeper.

There is nothing on the page itself, suggesting that the encryption is being handled server side. Let's fire up Burp Suite and see if we can get some more information by investigating the requests we make to the site.

See [GET aHEAD](https://github.com/DjikstraCS/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/PicoCTF/Web%20Exploitation/GET%20aHEAD.md) for more detailed information about how to set up Burp Suite.

This is our first request. At the bottom we can see the input we gave, along with a debug value set to `0`, what happens if we change it to `1`?

Instead of a blank page, we now get a debug message. It contains the SQL query we made, but it looks strange, the 'or' we put in has been changed to 'be'.

Let's try and put in a bigger input and see what happens, ex `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.

It's just a simple Caesar cipher with a rotation of 13, also known as 'ROT13'. It's interesting because the same operation that encrypts it, also decrypts it, which means that we just need to input `be` instead of `or` and we should be able to log in. Let's try again with `' be 1=1--`.

We got the flag!

**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3n_m0r3_SQL_7f5767f6}`
