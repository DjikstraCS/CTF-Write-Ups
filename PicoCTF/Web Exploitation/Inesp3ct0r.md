## Solution:
It we clock on how we will be presented with a list.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

This is probably where we will find our flags.

Right click anywhere -> 'Inspect (Q)'.

We will first have a look at the HTML section of the page. By clicking the small arrows de can expand the different sections of the page to investegate.

And we find the first part of the flag imbedded in the HTML.

Under the 'Style Editor' tab we kan see the CSS style sheets of the page.
