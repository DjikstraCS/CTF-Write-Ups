## Problem:

## Solution:
The page has a text field and a button, if you click it an error warning pops up saying 'That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie'.

We need to dig deeper, right click anywhere on the page -> 'Inspect (Q)'.

This is the built-in page inspector in Firefox. It is mainly used by web developers to make great websites. It will tell us everything we need to know about any web page. Go to the storage section.

Here we can see that we have a cookie with value of `-1`.

What happens if we change it to `1`?

OBS: Remember to refresh the page after editing the cookie, don't just click the 'Search' button!

A new message appears on the page saying what we have provided the page it with an acceptable cookie. Great!

We are on the right track, let's try some bigger numbers `{2..18}` and see what happens.

There we have it, with the value of the cookie set to `18` the page is satisfied and gives us the flag!
