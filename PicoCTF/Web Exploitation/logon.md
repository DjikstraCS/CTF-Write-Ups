---
## Hints:
1. Hmm, it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

---
## Solution:
When we try to log in as Joe, we get denied.

When we try to log in with any other credentials, we succeeded but see no flag.

Hmmâ€¦ Upon further inspection of the page, we can see that we have a cookie called 'admin'.

It's set to false, let's change that and refresh the page.

We got the flag!
